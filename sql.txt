ANY operator 
The ANY operator lets you perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values. The range of values comes from the execution of a subquery. 
The syntax of a statement that uses an ANY operator is as follows: 
        SELECT column_name(s) 
        FROM table_name 
        WHERE column_name comparison operator ANY 
          (SELECT column_name 
          FROM table_name 
          WHERE condition); 

ALL operator 
Use the ALL operator for the same purpose as the ANY operator. However, the way it works is a little bit different. 
It returns a boolean value as a result of performing a comparison operation. It returns TRUE only if ALL subquery values meet the given condition. In other words, 
the condition will be TRUE only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 
The syntax for the ALL operator is as follows: 
        SELECT column_name(s) 
        FROM table_name 
        WHERE column_name operator ALL 
          (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition); 


REPLACE statement : inset or update data in a table by deleting and replacing existing records
-checks for the primary or unique key of existing records 
- adds new data if no matching key is found 
- deletes and replaces th existing record if a match is found 
syntax:
        REPLACE INTO table_name (column1, column2) 
        VALUES (column1_value, column2_value) ;

        REPLACE INTO table_name 
        SET column_name = value, column2 = value ;
